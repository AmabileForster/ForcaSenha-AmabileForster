### The password strength checker is based on the following rules:

If the password is longer than 1 character - 1 point;
If the password has more than 6 characters - 2 points;
If the password has 10 or more characters - 3 points;
If the password has 12 or more characters - 4 points;
If the password has 14 or more characters - 5 points;
If the password contains at least one number - +1 point;
If the password contains at least one capital letter - +1 point;
If the password contains at least one lowercase character - +1 point;
If the password contains at least one special character (non-alphanumeric) - +2 points;
Total possible points: 10.

The password will be considered "Strong" if it scores 9 or more points;

The password will be considered "Moderate" if it scores more than 5 and less than 9 points;

The password will be considered "Weak" if it scores 5 points or less.

It must be possible to switch between hidden and non-hidden typing;

The password strength progression should be displayed as the user types in the password, as in the prototype below.
